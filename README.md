### Slack Workflow

To be able to run the workflow you would need to have the following:
- fork of the repo called my-fork on your CLI
- branches slack-bot and slack-bot-graphs in your fork
- modify your slack_bot.py to include the correct link for the image
- file webhook_url.txt in your working dir (not on git for obvious reasons)
- you just run slack_bot.py
